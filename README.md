# Lessons Learned
I learned more about how the bufferedReader works. I can see more now, why we don't need to understand the inner mechanisms of it, just need to know it reads in a file. I'm feeling a bit more comfortable with creating subclasses and how to implement them but wouldn't say I'm 100% there yet.
